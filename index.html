                <strong>National Museum of Fine Arts</strong><br><br>
                The National Museum of Fine Arts in the Philippines is a museum that features hundreds of 
                different mediums of art made by Filipinos such as paintings, sculptures, lace art, and sketches. 
                Some of these pieces date back as far as World War 2. Most of the subjects in these pieces are 
                reflections of events that took place during the time of its making and religious art.
            </p>
            <p>
                Even works of art from centuries past should be preserved because they accurately capture the culture, 
                society, and historical events of the time they were created. In the context of the Philippines, 
                the paintings and sculptures remind us of the struggles endured by our ancestors and the causes 
                for which our national heroes battled.
            </p>
            <p>
                A challenge regarding cultural heritage that can be observed is the lack of interest in or desire to 
                understand more about the background of Filipino artists' works, even with popular pieces such as the “SPOLIARIUM”. 
                They are simply viewed as exhibits and have no personal/cultural connection to the audience, which can cause them to forget or 
                become uninterested in certain aspects of our culture. Schools and the government ought to value our local artists in order to
                 address this. Learning about local artists, particularly those from the era when the Philippines was under colonization, 
                 can help us connect with our culture and look back at our history in ways other than simply practising our folk dances, songs, 
                 wearing traditional attire or reading off of textbooks that write about the events that took place during that particular time.

                <h2>Personal reflection</h2>
                <p>
                    Visiting the museum was an exciting experience for me as an art enthusiast. The sculptures were particularly 
                    fascinating, especially given their age and preservation. Smaller pieces were better maintained compared to the larger, 
                    life-sized ones. The freedom of expression in the sculptures, including depictions of nude women, stood out as a reflection
                     of the artists' creativity. This freedom serves as inspiration for modern artists to push boundaries and create art that 
                     reflects themselves or the current events, leaving a legacy for future generations.

            <h2>What can we do to promote the preservation of Philippine fine arts?</h2>
            <p>
                Some ways we can preserve cultural artworks as students is by suggesting or encouraging schools to do more field trips in places that showcase Philippine art and culture so
                students are able to see and appreciate these things for themselves. In this digital era, we must utilize and 
                maximize our technology when advocating for such issues. We can post photos, videos, blogs or vlogs showcasing Philippine art to a 
                wide range of audiences nationally or even internationally.

                    <strong>Gallery 8: BATAAN</strong><br><br>
                    Gallery 8 at the Philippine National Museum of Fine Arts is a
                    noteworthy gallery featuring artworks depicting the atrocities in Bataan. Despite being graphic, it resonated with me as a viewer because it 
                    depicted the events that took place when the pieces were made. Given the background, it evokes a different
                    kind of admiration and empathy.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It may be hard for some people to understand or appreciate the artwork. Despite that, these preservations 
                    spark curiosity amongst Filipino youth regarding our culture- some of which may have not been discussed in 
                    classroom settings.
